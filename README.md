2. - install dependencies:

### üïπ How to use:

1. Create a profile and choose whether you are a customer, who buys, or a bake who sells.

2. In a case when you are a customer, you only can buy products by putting them into your basket and do a checkout.

3. If you're a baker, you can add your products to the product page and sell them. CRUD manipulation is also available but only on your own products!

4. Upon uploading your pastries (or other food) you need to choose a name, a price, a description, available quantity and a photo for it.

5. üìå Option A: If you'd like your own photo, you can upload it and it will be shown on the products#index and also product#show pages (thanks to [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/)).

6. üìå Option B: You don't necassarily have to upload your own photo.According to the name given to your product, the web application will fetch data (in this case a picture) through the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers), and automatically upload a picture for your product. **_(Just make sure that you spell the name correctly and it's in english)_**
